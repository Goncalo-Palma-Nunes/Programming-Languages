# Implemented Features
All exercises provided in the file **SecondProject.v** were completed.

# Extras
Two different statements for **hoare_choice** (**hoare_choice'** and **hoare_choice''**) were proved. An additional theorem was proved, showing that both versions of **hoare_choice** are equivalent. This was done by showing that if we have the necessary premisses to apply one of the theorems, than we also have the premisses for the other one.

The exercise **hoare_choice_example** was solved twice, once with each of the hoare_choice theorems.
