# Implemented Features
All required features mentioned in the project statement and, in particular, in the table on the **Assessment** section of the project statement have been implemented.

# Extras
- Optimized versions of aeval and beval were created in Imp.v and proven to have the same results as the unoptimized versions.
- A sketch of a possible optimized step-index evaluator ceval_step_opt was implemented, but not proved sound. Most of it is commented out, because the initial idea was to add each optimization incrementally, while adjusting the proof.
